### Hi I'm Lider! 👋

<!--
**LiderNebi/LiderNebi** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🧑‍💼 Highly motivated Computer Programing student and Mechanical Engineering graduate, with a proven track
record in time management, and the ability to pivot and adapt to any work environment.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about front-end languages and frameworks such as Javascript, Node.js and React.
